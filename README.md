# Title - Augmented Reality Game Therapy for Autism Childrens
This project presents progress on treating children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using 
Augmented Reality based games. The aim of these games is to enhance social interaction and 
hand-eye coordination in children with ASD thus easing them into becoming more comfortable 
around unfamiliar people. Colour detection, tracking and motion tracking concepts in augmented 
reality have been used to develop games for young children with ASD. The idea is that these games 
will encourage concentration and imagination from children through repetitive movement and visual feedback.
